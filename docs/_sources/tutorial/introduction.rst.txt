Introduction
============

The goal of this tutorial is to design a workflow from scratch to detection earthquakes with `beamnetresponse`. We first download the data and preprocess them, then we compute the beamformed network response with `beamnetresponse` and identify earthquake detections based on a number of tunable parameters. Finally, we visualize the waveforms of the detected events.

Environment
-----------

The tutorial requires a larger number of Python packages than `beamnetresponse` itself. Creating the virtual environment as described here is *essential* for running successfully the tutorial. We will use the python package manager `Anaconda`, or rather its ligther version `Miniconda`. Follow the instructions here `https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_ to install `Miniconda`.

Once `Anaconda` or `Miniconda` is installed, you can use the `conda` commands. We will first make sure that `conda` uses packages from `conda-forge` when necessary:


.. code-block:: console

    $ conda config --add channels conda-forge

We will then create a Python 3.10 environment named `bnr_tuto`:


.. code-block:: console

    $ conda create -n bnr_tuto python=3.10 compilers

Note that we also added the `compilers` package to the environment to make sure that you locally install a recent C compiler. We now need to activate this environment:


.. code-block:: console

    $ conda activate bnr_tuto


Run the following command to install all the packages need for this tutorial:


.. code-block:: console

    $ conda install obspy pyasdf numpy scipy pandas matplotlib h5py ipython jupyter cartopy


Finally, we need to install `beamnetresponse` to our new environment. We refer you to :ref:`Installation` Setion of the documentation.
